# ArithmeticParser

This project was created as a hands-on way to explore and understand the concepts of tokenizing, parsing, and building abstract syntax trees.

It allows users to input an arithmetic expression and see how it is parsed into a tree structure, which is then visualized in the browser. The visualization helps demystify how expressions like `2 + 3 * (4 - 1)` are broken down and evaluated according to operator precedence and parentheses.

This was also an opportunity to learn how to:
* Build a frontend app with Blazor WebAssembly
* Visualize trees using browser technologies
* Host a static web app using GitHub Pages
